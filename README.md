# Install a Solace Message Router onto a Google Compute Engine Linux Virtual Machine

The Solace PubSub+ Software Broker (formerly known as VMR) provides enterprise-grade messaging capabilities deployable in any computing environment. The PubSub+ Software Broker provides the same rich feature set as Solaceâ€™s proven hardware appliances, with the same open protocol support, APIs and common management. The VMR can be deployed in the datacenter or natively within all popular private and public clouds.

# How to Deploy a VMR
This is a 2 step process:

* Download and install the Google SDK on your computer
See https://cloud.google.com/sdk/

* Clone this project, run the `create-centos-vmr-ha-group.sh` script for a full HA triplet with built-in redundancy.
This will create three GCE compute nodes with disks for your VMRs and download, install and initialize the latest Solace PubSub+ standard version on those nodes.  In addition, a load balancer and a default set of firewall rules will be created, these should be reviewed and updated as required.  Certain messaging protocols require the user to choose ports for each protocol, as these messaging services are provisioned, the user will need to update the firewall rules.

# Set up network security to allow access
Now that the VMR is instantiated, the network security firewall rule should be reviewed and updated as required.  Certain messaging protocols require the user to choose ports, as these messaging services are provisioned, the user will need to update the firewall rules.

For more information on the ports required for the message router see the [configuration defaults](http://docs.solace.com/Solace-VMR-Set-Up/VMR-Configuration-Defaults.htm)
. For more information on Google Cloud Platform Firewall rules see [Networking and Firewalls](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls)

# Gaining admin access to the VMR

For persons used to working with Solace message router console access, this is still available with the google compute engine instance.  Access the web ssh terminal window by clicking the [ssh] button next to your VMR instance,  then launch a SolOS cli session:

`sudo docker exec -it solace /usr/sw/loads/currentload/bin/cli -A`

For persons who are unfamiliar with the Solace mesage router or would prefer an administration application the SolAdmin management application is available.  For more information on SolAdmin see the [SolAdmin page](http://dev.solace.com/tech/soladmin/).  To get SolAdmin, visit the Solace [download page](http://dev.solace.com/downloads/) and select OS version desired.  Management IP will be the Public IP associated with youe GCE instance and port will be 8080 by default.

# Testing data access to the VMR

To test data traffic though the newly created VMR instance, visit the Solace developer portal and and select your preferred programming langauge to [send and receive messages](http://dev.solace.com/get-started/send-receive-messages/). Under each language there is a Publish/Subscribe tutorial that will help you get started.
